    "Britannica defines poverty as \"the state of one who lacks a usual or socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions\" causing thme to \"lack the means to satisfy their basic needs\" (1). While this definition is relatively vague and open to interpretation, especially in regard to what constitues as a basic need, the underlying gist is that a person who lives in poverty cannot pay for food, clean water, clothing, and shelter. While the measure of poverty varies across nations, where in its extreme it's recognized as living on less than $1.90 per day in the USA, the marker for living in poverty is not as low as you may think (2). In fact, roughly 11.6% of the US population lives in poverty (as of January 2021) -- that's 37.9 million Americans (3). \n",
    "\n",
    "People generally associate poverty exclusively to income, but that's a tremendous misconcpetion. In reality, poverty can be measured across 3 dimensions: health, education, and standard of living (2). This means when examining poverty, professionals look at child mortality rates and nutrition, school attendance, and electricity, sanitation, and housing, to give a few examples. This means poverty is not only what you can and cannot buy, but likewise an the quality of one's overall human exeperience. \n",
    "\n",
    "Poverty can be a difficult topic of study as it's not only difficult to define, but also difficult to generalize. There are many factors to consider when examining poverty rates in the USA. This includes age, gender, immigration status, familial status, ethnicity, geographical location, disability, race, and income, just to name a few examples, and it's increasingly difficult when you take into account that the aformentioned factors are not independent --  in most cases they intersect. While we recognize all the factors mentioned above are important, in this project we will only look at race and income for the sake of being as thorough as we can. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to analyze poverty across America in the context of race. In other words, we're looking to see if there's a trend between poverty status and the race in which one identifies as to see if race is an indicator of poverty and we'll look closely at income in our research. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do certain races tend to have higher poverty rates than others? On the flip side, do certain races have have lower rates than others? The goal in asking these questions and making the differentiation based on race is to indubitabily inidentify social and economic inequalities in American society. Certain members of our country endure systematic discrimination on account of their race that keeps them from recieving the same opprotunities and having the same experiences as their counterparts. If there is indeed a correaltion between poverty and race that would mean many Americans are enduring an injustice that they'll like never be able to break away from. And because poverty is a cycle, families will be affected across generations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we can recognize that these inequalities, and prove so beyond a shadow of a doubt, we can then take steps to rectify the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this study we recognize the following 5 races: White, Black, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native, and we'll look at poverty statistics collected by the US government, as far back as 1959 and as recently as 2022, that record these races so that can can make direct generalizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've collected tables that look at per capita income, poverty rates in regards to the total US population, and poverty status by race which we'll thoroughly analyze to make a confident hypothesis. We'll then use linear regression and machine learning to accept or reject this hypothesis. \n",

    "Our tutorial begins with collecting, processing and cleaning out data. As you can see, we've combined the first 2 stages of the data science pipeline. We've done this because collecting the data and processing it as you go is often the most organized and consistent course of action. Once you have your data, you might as well process and clean so it while its right. These prevents forgetting steps in cleaning data and data loss that can occur when switching back and forth between dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you're probably wondering why to even bother cleaning data. Here are several reasons why its important: \n",
    "\n",
    "- You can present your data in a more human readable form, that allows for easier and more accurate interpretation of data.\n",
    "- It ensures data is in the correct format to be used later on. For example, making sure dollars are integers or floats so we can perform calculations on them. \n",
    "- It makes the data more concise because we can drop columns that are not useful and rows that are incomplete (such as because of null values).\n",
    "- Going back to add changes when necessary is easier when all the cleaning code is with the table collection because everything is in one place."
